## Pacman
Pacman is a classic game. This one is created on Java and JavaX APIs.
I have made AI for the Enemy using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path to Pacman.

This was our Data Science Mini Project. I have used ProirityQueue, which is the
main component of Dijkstra's algorithm.

```
javac PacmanGame.java   # Compile it
java PacmanGame         # Run it
```

*I hope u like it. ;)*
